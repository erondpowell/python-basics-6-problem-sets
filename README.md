# Problems from MITx 6.00.1 coursework.

These problem sets were presented to students in case-study format.
In certain sets, like pset-4, helper code was provided by instructors.
Function and class definitions were given in order to allow for automated grading and provide some degree of scaffholding.
The actual programming is left to the students.


## pset-1: Control Operators and Iterables.
Task: Write logic that iterates through a string and prints the longest substring of alphabetically ordered characters. (example: it should print abcd from 'zyxabcdaa')

## pset-4: More Functional Programming
Task: Build a version of scrabble to let a human play alone then another to play against the computer.
